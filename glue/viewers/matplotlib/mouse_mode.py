"""
MouseModes define various mouse gestures.

MouseModes are generally activated and deactivated by toolbar buttons, although
not necessarily so. The toolbar maintains a list of MouseModes from the
visualization it is assigned to, and sees to it that only one MouseMode is
active at a time.

Each MouseMode appears as an Icon in the toolbar. Classes can assign methods to
the press_callback, move_callback, and release_callback methods of each Mouse
Mode, to implement custom functionality

The basic usage pattern is thus:
 * visualization object instantiates the MouseModes it wants
 * each of these is passed to the add_tool method of the toolbar
 * visualization object optionally attaches methods to the 3 _callback
   methods in a MouseMode, for additional behavior
