Full changelog
==============

v0.6 (unreleased)
-----------------

* When saving a session, if no extension is specified, the .glu extension is
  added. [#729]

* Added a GUI plugin manager in the 'Plugins' menu. [#682]

* Added an option to specify whether to use an automatic aspect ratio for image
  data or whether to enforce square pixels. [#717]

* Data factories can now be given priorities to determine which ones should
  take precedence in ambiguous cases. The ``set_default_factory`` and
  ``get_default_factory`` functions are now deprecated since it is possible to
  achieve this solely with priorities. [#719]

* Registering data factories should now always be done with the
  ``@data_factory`` decorator, and not by adding functions to
  ``__factories__``, as was possible in early versions of Glue. [#724]

* ``qglue`` now correctly interprets HDUList objects. [#598]

* Internal improvements to organization of domain-specific code (such as the
