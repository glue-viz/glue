Working with Data
=================

If you are writing Python code that uses Glue, you will probably want work
with data. The hierarchy of data objects in Glue looks like this:

.. image:: glue_hierarchy.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: Glue Hierarchy


* :class:`Component`
    Each :class:`Component` object stores a numpy
    array -- this is where the actual, numerical information resides.

* :class:`Data`
    The :class:`Data` object stores (among other things) one or more
    components. Each Component stores the information about one
    quantity. In a catalog, each column is a distinct Component. All
    of the Components stored with a Data object must have numpy arrays
    with the same shape. Components are referenced in the Data via
    :class:`ComponentID` objects.

* :class:`~glue.core.data_collection.DataCollection`
    The DataCollection stores one or more Data sets. If you want to
    examine multiple files in a Glue session, you load each file into
    a different Data object and store them in a DataCollection


Creating :class:`Data` objects
------------------------------
.. _data_creation:

If you need to build your own data objects, the code looks something
like this::

   from glue.core import Component, Data, DataCollection
   import numpy as np
   data = Data(label="first dataset")
   x = Component( np.array([1, 2, 3]))
   y = Component( np.array([4, 5, 6]))
   x_id = data.add_component(x, label = 'X')
   y_id = data.add_component(y, label = 'Y')
   collection = DataCollection([data])

Alternatively, you can pass numpy arrays directly to ``Data``::

    x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    y = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    data = Data(label="first dataset", x=x, y=y)
    collection = DataCollection([data])

Loading from files
-------------------

The functions in ``glue.core.data_factories`` create
:class:`~glue.core.Data` objects from files. For example::

    from glue.core.data_factores import *
    load_data('image.fits', factory=gridded_data)  # reads a fits image
    load_data('catalog.csv', factory=tabular_data) # reads a catalog
    load_data('catalog.csv')  # guesses factory, based on file extension

If these functions do not fit your needs, you can also :ref:`write your own
data loader <custom_data_factory>`, and use it from the Glue GUI.


Working with :class:`Data` and :class:`DataCollection` objects
--------------------------------------------------------------
.. _data_access_api:

The DataCollection behaves like a list -- you can access Data objects
by indexing into it::

    In [1]:  dc
    Out[1]:
    DataCollection (2 data sets)
          0: w5
          1: w5_psc

    In [2]: dc[0]
    Out[2]: Data (label: w5)

This DataCollection has two data sets. Let's grab the first one::

    In [3]: data = dc[0]

    In [4]: data.components
    Out[4]: [PRIMARY, Pixel y, Pixel x, World y: DEC--TAN, World x: RA---TAN]

Data objects behave like dictionaries: you can retrieve the numerical data associated with each one with bracket-syntax::

    In [5]: data['PRIMARY']
    ... a numpy array ...

Note that this syntax gives you the numpy array, and not the Component object itself. This is usually what you are interested in. However, you can retrieve the Component object if you like with ``get_component``::

    In [6]: primary_id = data.components[0]

    In [7]: print primary_id, type(primary_id)
    Out[7]: PRIMARY <class 'glue.core.data.ComponentID'>

    In [8]: component = data.get_component(primary_id)  #component object
    In [9]: component.data   # numpy array

.. note:: The bracket syntax will not work if component labels are not unique. In this case, you must first retrieve the component object as shown above.
