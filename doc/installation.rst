Installing Glue
===============

There are several ways to install Glue on your computer. We recommend one of the first two options, which greatly simplify of the (sometimes tricky) task of installing QT, Matplotlib, and other libraries that Glue relies on.


Easiest Option (Recommended for Mac users)
------------------------------------------

Mac users with OS X >= 10.7 can download Glue as a `standalone program
<https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a7jbvaruzdrri8j/8En3jGR3n6>`_.


Easy Option (Recommended for Windows, Unix users)
-------------------------------------------------

We recommend using the `Anaconda
<http://continuum.io/downloads.html>`_ Python distribution from
Continuum Analytics. Anaconda includes all of Glue's main dependencies.

 * Download and install the `appropriate version of Anaconda
   <http://continuum.io/downloads.html>`_

 * On the command line, install Glue using pip: ``pip install -e git+git://github.com/glue-viz/glue-qt.git#egg=glue``

 * On the command line, install any additional Glue dependencies by running ``glue-deps install``. For more information on ``glue-deps``, see :ref:`below <glue-deps>`

The Entought Python Distribution also includes all non-trivial dependencies. The installation instructions are the same. You can download EPD `here <https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/>`_.

.. note:: Anaconda installs it's own version of Python

.. note:: This GitHub repository is different from the main Glue
          codebase, and includes pre-generated QT files. This is due
          to a bug in the current release of Anaconda, which doesn't
          include the QT compilation tools.


Building from Source (For the Brave)
------------------------------------

The source code for Glue is available on `GitHub
<http://www.github.com/glue-viz/glue>`_. Glue relies upon a number of
scientific python libraries, as well as the QT GUI library. Installing
these packages is somewhat beyond the scope of this document, and
unforunately trickier than it should be. If you want to dive in, here
is the basic strategy:

 * Install `Qt 4 <http://qt-project.org/downloads>`_ and either `PyQt4 <http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download>`_ or `PySide <http://qt-project.org/wiki/Get-PySide>`_. If at all possible, use the binary installers; building PyQt4 or PySide from source is tricky (this is a euphemism).

 * Install Glue using pip: ``pip install -e git+git://github.com/glue-viz/glue.git#egg=glue``. Alternatively, ``git clone`` the repository and install via ``python setup.py install``

 * Install Glue's remaining dependencies by running ``glue-deps install``. For more information on these dependencies see :ref:`below <glue-deps>`.



Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _glue-deps:

Glue has a few essential dependencies (like PyQT4 or PySide and
numpy), and several recommended dependencies to support various I/O
and optional functionality. Glue includes a command line utility
``glue-deps`` to manage these dependencies.

Calling ``glue-deps list`` displays all of Glue's required and optional dependencies, along with whether or not each library is already installed on your system. For missing dependencies, the program also provides a brief description of how it is used within Glue.

Calling ``glue-deps install`` attempts to ``pip install`` all missing libraries. You can install single libraries or categories of libraries by providing additional arguments to ``glue-deps install``.

Tips for Ubuntu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many dependencies can be reliably installed with ``apt``::

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy
    sudo apt-get install python-scipy
    sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
    sudo apt-get install python-qt4
    sudo apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools
    sudo apt-get install ipython
    sudo apt-get install python-zmq
    sudo apt-get install python-pygments


Mac Ports
^^^^^^^^^
Many dependencies can be reliably installed with::

    sudo port install python27
    sudo port install py27-numpy
    sudo port install py27-scipy
    sudo port install py27-matplotlib
    sudo port install py27-pyqt4
    sudo port install py27-ipython
    sudo port install py27-pip

installation, see `here

Running Glue
------------

Installing glue from source will create a executable ``glue`` script
that should be in your path. Running ``glue`` from the command line will
start the program. Glue accepts a variety of command-line
arguments. See ``glue --help`` for examples.

.. note:: On Windows, installation creates an executable ``glue.exe`` file within the python script directory (e.g., ``C:\Python27\Scripts``). Windows users can create a desktop shortcut for this file, and run Glue by double clicking on the icon.
