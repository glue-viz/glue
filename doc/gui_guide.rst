Guide to the GUI
================

Main Application Window
-----------------------

   Glue's main interface

The main window consists of 3 areas:

 A. The **data manager**. This lists all open data sets and subsets (highlighted regions)
 B. The **visualization area**. This is where each visualization window resides
 C. The **visualization dashboard**. This shows the options for the active visualization window.

Data Magager
^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. figure:: data_manager.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300px

A. An open data set. This dataset is also :ref:`highlighted <multi_selection_note>`.
B. A subset associated with ``data 1``
C. The **Open Data** button
D. Add a **New Subset** to the highlighted dataset
E. **Delete** the highlighted items
F. Open the **Link Data** dialog to define connections between data
G. Toggle the Python **Terminal**

Right Clicking on an entry in the data manager brings up a menu of options (also available within the ``Data Manager`` menu):

   :align: center

This menu has the following entries:

 * **Change Label**: Change the name of the selection (here, ``data1.1``)
 * **Change Color**: Change the color (and opacity) associated with the selection (here, red)
 * **Change Size**: Change point size for relevant visualizations
 * **Change Symbol**: Change point symbol for relevant visualizations
 * **Load Subset**: Load a subset previously saved with ``Save Subset``
 * **Save Subset**: Write the selected subset to a FITS mask of 1s and 0s
 * **Copy Cubset**: Copy the definition of the subset to the clipboard
 * **Paste Subset**: Overwrite this subset with the subset previously copied to the clipboard
 * **Paste Special**: Instead of overwriting on paste, use boolean combination (add to selection, remove from selection, etc.)
 * **New Subset**: Create a new subset associated with the highlighted data
 * **Clear Subset**: Reset the subset definition to the null set
 * **Duplicate Subset**: Create a new subset whose region definition matches the current selection
 * **Delete Layer**: Remove the selected items from the data manager and visualizations
 * **Create Faceted Subsets**: Create several subsets by partitioning a dataset by one of its quantities (similar to a histogram)
 * **Union Combine**: Create a new subset that is the combination of the selected subsets
 * **Intersection Combine**: Create a new subest that is the intersection of the selected subsets
 * **Xor combine**: Create a new subset that is the exclusive intersection of the selected subsets (i.e. union - intersection)
 * **Invert**: Invert the current selection
 * **Define New Component**: Launch a new window to add a new component to the data
 * **Link Data**: open the Link Data dialog
 * **Plot Data**: An alternative to dragging the entry into the visualization area. Creates a new visualization of the selection

Terminal Window
----------------
The terminal window provides an IPython shell with access to the
variables used by Glue. You can use this to inspect the state of Glue
as it runs, analyze data in place, etc.

The main variables available by default form the termainal
window are ``data_collection``, ``dc`` (an alias to
``data_collection``), and ``hub``.

In addition, you can drag individual datasets or subsets into the terminal,
and assign them to local variables.

For examples of how to inspect data objects in Glue (including
how to extract Numpy arrays from them), see the
:ref:`data guide <data_tutorial>`.
